                    <p className='p1'>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, in the present-day Indian state of Gujarat.was raised in a devout Hindu family. His father was the chief minister of Porbandar, and his mother was deeply religious. Gandhi was a shy and studious child who showed little interest in sports but had a strong moral compass from an early age. At the age of 13, he married Kasturba in an arranged marriage, as was customary in India at the time. Gandhi's family values, religious upbringing, and exposure to the principles of truth and nonviolence from Hindu scriptures laid the foundation for his later philosophy and activism. He was small and dark, and looked no different from the millions of other children born in India. Yet this was no ordinary child.</p>

                    <p className='p2'>In his early years, Gandhi was deeply influenced by the stories of Shravana and Harishchandra that reflected the importance of truth. Through these stories and from his personal experiences, he realized that truth and love are among the supreme values. Mohandas married Kasturba Makhanji at the age of 13. Gandhi later went on to reveal that the marriage didn’t mean anything to him at that age and that he was happy and excited only about wearing new set of clothes.At the age of 19, Mohandas left home to study law in London at the Inner Temple, one of the city’s four law colleges. Upon returning to India in mid-1891, he set up a law practice in Bombay, but met with little success. He soon accepted a position with an Indian firm that sent him to its office in South Africa. Along with his wife, Kasturbai, and their children, Gandhi remained in South Africa for nearly 20 years.</p>

                    <p className='p1'>After his family moved to Rajkot, a nine year old Gandhi was enrolled at a local school, where he studied the basics of arithmetic, history, geography and languages. When he was 11 years old, he attended a high school in Rajkot. He lost an academic year in between because of his wedding but later rejoined the school and eventually completed his schooling. He then dropped out of Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State after joining it in the year 1888. Later Gandhi was advised by a family friend Mavji Dave Joshiji to pursue law in London.Supported by his brother, Gandhi left to London and attended the Inner Temple and practiced law. During his stay in London, Gandhi joined a Vegetarian Society and was soon introduced to Bhagavad Gita by some of his vegetarian friends. The contents of Bhagavad Gita would later have a massive influence on his life. </p>

                    <p className='p2'>After returning to India, Gandhi struggled to find work as a lawyer. In 1893, Dada Abdullah, a merchant who owned a shipping business in South Africa asked if he would be interested to serve as his cousin’s lawyer in South Africa. Gandhi gladly accepted the offer and left to South Africa, which would serve as a turning point in his political career.In South Africa, he faced racial discrimination directed towards blacks and Indians. He faced humiliation on many occasions but made up his mind to fight for his rights. This turned him into an activist and he took upon him many cases that would benefit the Indians and other minorities living in South Africa.After spending 21 years in South Africa, where he fought for civil rights, he had transformed into a new person and he returned to India in 1915. </p>

                    <p className='p0'>The Development of Satyagraha</p><br></br>
                    <p className='p1'>The term "Satyagraha" was first coined by Gandhi in South Africa in 1906 during the struggle against racial discrimination faced by Indians. It combines two Sanskrit words: "Satya" meaning truth and "agraha" meaning insistence or holding firmly to. Thus, Satyagraha can be understood as "truth force" or "soul force."Satyagraha is built on the principle of ahimsa, or nonviolence, which Gandhi believed to be the highest form of moral conduct.Satyagraha emphasizes the importance of truth, courage, and self-suffering in the pursuit of justice. It encourages individuals to resist injustice without resorting to violence, even in the face of repression.Upon returning to India in 1915, Gandhi brought Satyagraha with him and applied it to the Indian freedom struggle. He led several campaigns, including the Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience Movement, all based on the principles of Satyagraha.</p>

                        <li><strong>Ahimsa (Nonviolence):</strong> Central to Gandhi's philosophy was the principle of ahimsa, or nonviolence.
